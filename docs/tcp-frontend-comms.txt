node.js express <--> scrubdev.cs
    Structure:
        1. Instruction
        2. Spacer
        3. Arguments
        5. Stream end


    Definitions:
        Instruction
            Data sent according to the structure
            Arguments should be separated by comma (",")

        Spacer
            Just a space

        Stream end
            Indicates the end of the tcp message. Should just be \r\n (CARRIAGE RETURN, LINE FEED)


    Instruction definitions (express --> scrubdev <client-server>):
        pathfind
        Pathfinds to a target
            (Int) grid X
            (Int) grid Y

        sleep
        Sleeps bot - Server side should handle that lights go off right away, motors go off in ~5 mins
            (Bool?) forces an on or off - default toggles

        home
        Requests to recalibrate and center on home
            (No args)


    Instruction definitions (scrubdev --> express <server-client>):
        welcome
        Sent upon connection to the tcp server - express end should cache this and update as is
            (Int) status as below.

        status
        Updates the express client of the current status of the bot. This should update the vue.js frontend
            (Int) status where: 1 - Navigating, 0 - Idle, -1 - Sleep (lights), -2 - Deep Sleep (motor)


    Examples
        (The below <\r\n> are simulated returns, in real request put actual returns)
        Navigate with pathfinding to (69, 420)
            tcp client-server: pathfind 69,420<\r\n>

        Bot has went to sleep, informing the client
            tcp server-client: status -1<\r\n>
